   <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
   <p>
    Quorsera's website is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. 
    Not all knowledge can be written down, but much of that which can be, still isn't. 
    It remains in people’s heads or only accessible if you know the right people. 
    We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together 
    people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to 
    share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.

                <h3>MISSION</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The mission of Quorsera is questions — questions that affect the world, questions that explain 
                  recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide 
                  insights into why other people think differently. Quorsera is a place where you can ask questions 
                  that matter to you and get answers from people who have been there and done that. 
                  Quorsera is where scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, mechanics, and homemakers take refuge from
                   misinformation and incendiary arguments to share what they know.</p>

                <h3> VISION</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Great writers help you understand why the world works the way it does, why people 
                  behave the way they do, and what we can all do to make the world better. Millions of 
                  people search the web for answers and millions of people write answers on Quora, every week.
                  Quora’s answers come from people who really understand the issues and have first-hand 
                  knowledge.There are innumerable problems in society that do not have a solution. 
                  The ratio is 2 problems for each individual. That means if every person solves any 2 problems 
                  serves the country/world directly. In the end, there would be fewer problems and more solutions 
                  and thinkers in society. 
                  Quorsera is where you can read important insights that have never been shared anywhere else, 
                  from people you could never reach any other way.</p>
